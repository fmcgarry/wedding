<p>
    Everything on this site was created by me, Freddy! (with input from Bre, of course 😊)
    This is what I do for a living. I design, build, program, and maintain software solutions. 
    There's a lot more to this website than what you can see here, so if you're curious about what it 
    takes to create something like this, here are some statistics:

    1. I started building this project in early January of 2024.
    2. In total, I probably spent around 50 hours building everything from scratch.
    3. Of those hours, Bre spent many of them playing Slime Rancher while I worked and occasially glanced up to comment on her game.
    3. Anything entered on this site is safely stored somewhere only I can access. I won't sell it... Unless?
